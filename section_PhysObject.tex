\section{Physical Objects Reconstruction and Selection}
\label{sec:PhysObj}

\subsection{Lepton}
	\label{ssec:PhysObj_lep}

		The selected lepton in the analysis is required to obey the criteria of one passed $\emph{selected lepton}$ and zero $\emph{veto lepton}$ passed. The veto criteria means that there would be no lepton passing the veto criteria except the selected one. In other words, the veto criteria can filter the physical objects which are lepton-like but not really like after reconstructed from particle level to detector level. The selected criteria corresponds to tight lepton's criteria, and veto criteria follows loose lepton's criteria:
