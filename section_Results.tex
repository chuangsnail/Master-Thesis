\section{Results and Conclusion}
\label{sec:Result}

	In 2016 data analysis of CP violation in $t\bar{t}$ semi-leptonic decay, a complete flow path has been finished. Also, improvements are applied in this analysis comparing to previous analysis. Mainly, the MVA technic is recommended for events reconstruction. The advantage of machine learning could make the signal purity increase, and make the reserved data's statistic higher. Therefore, besides the final organization of calculation results including uncertainty and dilution factor, the improvement of MVA method will be shown with comparing to original $\chi^2_{min}$ method.
